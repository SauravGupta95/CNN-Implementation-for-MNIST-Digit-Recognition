# CNN-Implementation-for-MNIST-Digit-Recognition
In this project, we aim to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. We will implement the network architecture, including convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max pooling, and fully connected layers followed by a softmax activation function. The project will be documented thoroughly and uploaded to GitHub.
